* Fix delete-all, stop, start commands functionality
* Add be-app-ctl command to manage particular backend
* Add wait-be-apps to check/wait backends availability
* Add hack (tricky start_be_apps function) to start backend in case it cannot be started when it's the single available backend by full nodes parameter list
